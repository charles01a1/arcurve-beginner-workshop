# arcurve-beginner-workshop
Thank you for coming to this Arcurve Event. This repository includes the template for a simple pong game created with pygame


To run this code you can use https://trinket.io/features/pygame for an online editor. 

Note - the frames for pygame run differently on differnt computers so you may need to slow or speed up the velocity of the balls or paddles
