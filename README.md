# arcurve-beginner-workshop
Thank you for coming to this Arcurve Event. This repository includes the template for a simple pong game created with pygame


To run this code you can use https://trinket.io/features/pygame for an online editor. 

Note - the frames for pygame run differently on differnt computers so you may need to slow or speed up the velocity of the balls or paddles.
This can be done on lines 73,76 and 79 of the pong template file
